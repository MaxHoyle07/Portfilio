            <p>During my time at Strode College studying Cyber Security, I have gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in network management. The course has provided me with a solid foundation in understanding network protocols, security measures, and best practices for managing network infrastructure. I have learned how to configure and manage various network devices, including routers, switches, and firewalls. Additionally, the course has emphasized the importance of network security, teaching me how to implement security measures to protect against potential threats and vulnerabilities.</p>

            <h3>College Network Management</h3>
            <p>At Strode College, I assist with the management of the college's network infrastructure. This includes configuring switches, routers, and access points to ensure optimal performance and security. I help manage user accounts and permissions, ensuring that students and staff have appropriate access to resources while maintaining network security.

            I also assist with troubleshooting network issues, working to identify and resolve connectivity problems, performance issues, and security concerns. This hands-on experience has allowed me to apply the knowledge gained from my coursework in a real-world setting, further enhancing my skills in network management and security.</p>
