                    <p>At Cruck Tent I created 3D models using blender and SketchUp of their products which were shown to customers to demonstrate what their products look like before they purchase them. In this position I was given detailed drawings of the structures which were being supplied to the clients and was tasked with creating a to scale 3D Model and scene for the client to view before completing their purchase. This was only done with high end clients who wanted to see how each Tent would look in the space provided and what materials they wanted. </p>
